\title{Function for Standardizing Regression Predictors by Centering and 
    Dividing by 2 sd's}

\description{Numeric variables that take on more than two values are each rescaled
     to have a mean of 0 and a sd of 0.5;
     Binary variables are rescaled to have a mean of 0 and a difference of 1
     between their two categories; 
     Non-numeric variables that take on more than two values are unchanged;
     Variables that take on only one value are unchanged

}
\usage{
\S4method{standardize}{lm}(object, unchanged = NULL, 
    standardize.y = FALSE, binary.inputs = "center")
\S4method{standardize}{glm}(object, unchanged = NULL, 
    standardize.y = FALSE, binary.inputs = "center")
\S4method{standardize}{mer}(object, unchanged = NULL, 
    standardize.y = FALSE, binary.inputs = "center")
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{an object of class \code{lm} or \code{glm}
  \item{unchanged}{vector of names of parameters to leave unstandardized}
  \item{standardize.y}{ if TRUE, the outcome variable is standardized also}
  \item{binary.inputs}{options for standardizing binary variables}
}

\details{
    "0/1" (rescale so that the lower value is 0 and the upper is 1)
    "-0.5/0.5" (rescale so that the lower value is -0.5 and upper is 0.5)
    "center" (rescale so that the mean of the data is 0 and the difference
              between the two categories is 1)
    "full" (rescale by subtracting the mean and dividing by 2 sd's)
    "leave.alone" (do nothing)
